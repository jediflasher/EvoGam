> Create a sample MVC(S) Robotlegs project

- I never used Robotlegs, Flex Unit (used tests in Ruby and Python) and Maven (used Ant only), so I spent more time than it was planned to read about it. 
Sorry, but I don't have enough time now to learn maven for test task (spent it to learn RL and Flex Unit). So there is no Maven configuration.

You used 0x00A0 symbol (nbsp), which was interpreted as xml node, that not contains @myVal property. Ther is 2 ways to fix it: 
1. Iterate over "node" children like: xmlData.node.(@myVal % 2 && trace(@myVal));
2. Replace nbsp to space or tab.
